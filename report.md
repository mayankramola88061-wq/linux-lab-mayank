# Linux Lab Report

## Experiment 1: Introduction to Ubuntu Operating System

**Aim:**  
To understand the basic structure and components of the Ubuntu Linux operating system.

**Apparatus Required:**  
Ubuntu Operating System installed on a computer or virtual machine.

**Theory:**  
Ubuntu is a popular Linux-based operating system. It provides a terminal interface that allows users to interact with the system using commands.  
Understanding the desktop environment, terminal, and file system structure is essential before learning advanced Linux concepts.

**Procedure:**
1. Start the Ubuntu system.  
2. Explore the desktop and launcher icons.  
3. Open the terminal using **Ctrl + Alt + T**.  
4. Run the command `pwd` to check the current directory.  
5. Observe the directory structure under `/home/username/`.

**Output:**  
(Screenshot showing terminal commands and output.)

**Result:**  
Successfully explored the Ubuntu interface and learned basic terminal navigation.

**Conclusion:**  
Gained basic understanding of the Ubuntu environment and its command-line interface# Linux Lab Report# Linux Lab Report

 Experiment 2: Basic Linux Commands

Aim:
To study and execute basic Linux commands for file and directory management.

Apparatus Required:
Ubuntu Operating System

Theory:
Linux commands are used to interact with the system and perform operations such as listing files, creating directories, copying, moving, and removing files.
Understanding these commands helps in efficiently managing files and navigating the Linux filesystem.

Procedure:
	1.	Open the Terminal using Ctrl + Alt + T.
	2.	Use pwd to display the present working directory.
	3.	Use ls to list the files and directories.
	4.	Use mkdir test to create a directory named test.
	5.	Use cd test to move into the test directory.
	6.	Use touch sample.txt to create an empty file.
	7.	Use cp sample.txt copy.txt to copy the file.
	8.	Use mv copy.txt moved.txt to rename the copied file.
	9.	Use rm moved.txt to delete the file.
	10.	Use cd .. to return to the parent directory and rmdir test to remove the empty directory.

Output:
(Screenshot showing terminal execution of commands and output.)

Result:
Successfully executed and verified the output of basic Linux commands for file and directory handling.

Conclusion:
Learned to manage files and directories using fundamental Linux commands.
